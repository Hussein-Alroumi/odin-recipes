    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This sauce is popular in Lebanese restaurants and usually served with chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of peeled garlic</li>
        <li>4 cups of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Half a cup of lemon juice but you can decrease according to your taste preference</li>
        <li>Add salt according to your taste preference.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the peeled garlic and the salt in the food processor and blend until it's well minced</li>
        <li>Run the oil very slowly in a thin stream and small batches at a time. When you first introduce the oil, start with only one tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Once it becomes airy and fluffy, it's your cue to continue making the garlic sauce by alternating between pouring in the oil and pouring in the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>To let the garlic set, cover it with a paper towel and store in the fridge, and let the flavors set in overnight before enjoying it.</li>
    </ol>
